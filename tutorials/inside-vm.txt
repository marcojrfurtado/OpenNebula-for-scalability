Se a VM não estiver conseguindo levantar a interface de rede, procure o arquivo /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules

Deixe ele desta maneira:
# This file was automatically generated by the /lib/udev/write_net_rules
# program, run by the persistent-net-generator.rules rules file.
#
# You can modify it, as long as you keep each rule on a single
# line, and change only the value of the NAME= key.

# PCI device 0x15ad:0x07b0 (vmxnet3) (custom name provided by external tool)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:50:56:87:00:25", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"

Verifique também a configuração da rede em: cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

Reset a rede, e tudo estará ok.

2 - Edit /etc/sudoers, adding the line '%sudo ALL:NOPASSWD ALL'
3 - Add Postgres to the sudo groups with 'usermod -a -G sudo postgres'


Add postgres to the ssl-cert group


The calibration VM must have hdparm installed.
