\chapter{\textbf{Final considerations}}

Even though OpenNebula's capabilities of scheduling enables a way of distribution of resources, this is not enough for consolidating resources. Its goal is not to analyze the application workload inside a VM. That's why the resources need to be required in a static way, in which it's not possible to reallocate resources.

The virtualization design advisor is a way of distributing these resources by considering the database workload. Although it generates overhead, it provides a way of dealing with both over- and under- utilization of resources. 


For a future work, the cloud infrastructure should be more exploited. Through live migration of VMs, a technology already supported by most hypervisors and OpenNebula, it's possible to transfer VMs from one host to another. This could be useful in cases which avoiding over-utilization of resources is not possible ( e.g. Too many VMs with high CPU needs ). This paper was limited to optimize the hosts internally.
