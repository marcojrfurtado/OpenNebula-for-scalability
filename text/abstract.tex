Cloud computing has attracted a lot of attention, both in researches and as a business model. It promises a lot of benefits, which include the possibility of cutting costs, better manageability of applications, better utilisation of computational resources, among others. In order to achieve its goals, the cloud is highly dependable on resource virtualization to provide its elasticity. At the same time, the demand for running database systems in virtualized environments grows as a topic in research papers. %Database systems running in the cloud has already been debated by some recent papers.

Database systems have particularities involving their workloads, when compared to regular applications. This raises some questions about how to optimize the resource allocation among database workloads in an elastic cloud environment. In this paper, we expose an implementation of a \textit{virtual design advisor} in the cloud. We implement a way of dynamically reallocate resources among virtual machines and use the advisor to optimize the resource distribution among virtualized database systems. The recommended allocations are dynamically updated, based on information about database workloads. %It bases its recommendations on database cost models.
