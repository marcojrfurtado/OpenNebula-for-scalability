The concept of cloud computing has been gaining a lot of attention lately, both in the business world and in research papers. Its popularity resides at the low costs it propitiates, opposed to  traditional ways of providing computational resources. The main advantage is its elasticity, in which they can be offered on-demand. On the other hand, new challenges arise because of this dynamism. A system needs to guarantee a proper scheduling of these resources, in order to fulfil an organization's demands. At the same time, it needs to meet its scheduling policies ( minimize costs, heigh availability, and so on )  and deal with peaks of demand.

The paper is dedicated to the study of an efficient algorithm.
