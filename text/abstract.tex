Private clouds can be used to consolidate several database management systems. They propitiate a reduction on the cost of ownership by allowing a better utilization of the available resources. The problem is how to split them among the database systems to achieve the best overall performance. In this paper, we focus on one resource, namely CPU. We expose an implementation of a virtualization design advisor. It aims to improve the CPU utilization for multiple database workloads running within a a determined host from a private cloud. This is achieved through the recommendation of  configuration parameters for a group of virtual machines, which contain the database systems.




%Cloud computing has attracted a lot of attention, both in researches and as a business model. It promises a lot of benefits, which include the possibility of cutting costs, better manageability of applications, better utilisation of computational resources, among others. In order to achieve its goals, the cloud is highly dependable on resource virtualization to provide its elasticity. At the same time, the demand for running database systems in virtualized environments grows as a topic in research papers. %Database systems running in the cloud has already been debated by some recent papers.

%Database systems have particularities involving their workloads, when compared to regular applications. This raises some questions about how to optimize the resource allocation among database workloads in an elastic cloud environment. In this paper, we expose an implementation of a \textit{virtual design advisor} in the cloud. We implement a way of dynamically reallocate resources among virtual machines and use the advisor to optimize the resource distribution among virtualized database systems. The recommended allocations are dynamically updated, based on information about database workloads. %It bases its recommendations on database cost models.
