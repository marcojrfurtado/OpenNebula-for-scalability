Cloud computing has attracted a lot of attention, both in researches and as a business model. It promises a lot of benefits, which include the possibility of cutting costs, better manageability of applications, better utilisation of computational resources, among others. In order to achieve its goals, the cloud is highly dependable on the virtualization of resources to provide its elasticity. At the same time, the demand for running database systems in virtualized environments grows. Database systems running in the cloud has already been debated by some recent papers.

Database systems have particularities involving their workloads, when compared to regular applications. This raises some questions about how to optimize the resource allocation among database workloads in a elastic cloud environment. In this paper, we propose an implementation of a \textit{virtual design advisor} in the cloud. Its goal is to improve the resource allocation among database management systems running inside virtual machines, by recommending configuration parameters for them. It bases its recommendations on database cost models.
